# Segmentation
    Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which corresponds to a different
    object or part of the image. The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something
    that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

    There are many different algorithms and approaches used for image segmentation, including thresholding, region growing, watershed, 
    active contours.
    
    Region growing means obtaining areas inside in which the values of some characteristics are uniform.
    
    We can have segmentation region oriented or contour oriented.
    
## Segmentation errors
    We can have :
    - Under segmentation: decomposing the image into fewer parts than needed.
    - Over segmentation: decomposing the image into more parts than needed.
